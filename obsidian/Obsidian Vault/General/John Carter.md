From the webinar on small account - Jan. 2025:
What's working:
* Setting up limit orders in advance for flushes into key support levels. Long calls, call debit spreads, or sell put spreads. Limit orders can work for days before they are filled.
* Iron condors 10 to 14 days out. Stable stocks like MCD, V
* Wide butterflies for overnight or multi day trades in the SPX
* Cash settled SPX trades placed into the final hour (put it on, walk away, check after close)
* Overnight trades in the SPX with appropriate risk to reward ratios. In the money credit spreads, wide butterflies
* Credit spreads with slightly larger size but enough time left to manage
* Exiting earlier than everyone else, first to exit (lower targets)
* We always had working exits, so don't have to keep checking. put "in front of everyone else" so they had a higher probability of hitting
* Stops were based on time. If we had a trade that was 14 days out, and 7 days out it hadn't hit the target - we would just exit
* For overnight SPX trades, we'd have a target working. If by 11 am it hadn't been hit - we'd just get out.
* 
What's not working:
* 50 point wide iron flies on SPX held overnight
* Friday pinning trades on equities like META, etc. too much work.
* Earnings trade - needs to be at market open for these
* Pushing into Friday expiration for equities. Too much can go wrong
* $5.00 wide SPX butterflies as directional trades. They don't move
* Looking at too many symbols. No FOMO

Goals:
* No holding the position for expiration (sometimes let SPX cash settle).
* Butterflies: 100% gain. 
* Debit spread: 100% gain, so buy at 25% of the spread, sell at 50% of the spread. If the target is 50% of the spread width, the buy limit should be 25-30% - for example: 10$ wide spread and we want to sell at 5$, so buy at 2.5-3 $
* Credit spread: If sell 5$ wide at 2 $, buy back at 1 $.

His trade log: Date, Symbol, Trade type (Butterfly, Credit spread, Iron Fly, Iron Condor, Debit Spread, Unbalanced Fly), Setup (5800/5815/5830, 225/220 pcs, 5 wide ATM 3 days out), Entry price, Expiration (0DTE, 1DTE, weekly, monthly), 40% Target, Exit Price, Point Gain or Loss, Percentage,  Contracts, Profit or Loss, Running P&L, Balance.

If we found we are exposed on the long side and the markets were extended, we'd add a simple 1 lot SPX out of the money PUT as an hedge. if goes down hedge is taken out while long positions still have time to recover.

Her system:
* Only long calls or puts
* Buy near support. Tools: her DPMR bands (Daily Price ), Darvas, MoMo (Momentum) and Trend indicators
* Dor day trading the nearest expiration. For day/swing trades - at least 10-14 days for sideways/chopping, 21 days or more preferred for trending (to capture the full potential of the trend). For choppy - the DTE you expect it to turn back. Ideally the OI should be > 1000 to provide good liquidity and small spreads.
* When she loses 25% of the premium paid - she exit the trade with a loss
