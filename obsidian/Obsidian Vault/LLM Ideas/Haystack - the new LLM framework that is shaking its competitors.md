Example of using Haystack to retrieve article from url and use it with RAG pipeline.
```sh
query = "Why did Stallman get frustrated when he tried to retrieve his print job from the new Xerox printer ?"

Stallman got frustrated when he tried to retrieve his print job from the new Xerox printer because only four pages in the printer's tray belonged to another user, meaning that Stallman's print job and the unfinished portion of somebody else's print job were still trapped somewhere within the electrical plumbing of the lab's computer network.
```
